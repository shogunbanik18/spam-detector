## Spam-Detector
Spam Detector is an online Email/SMS Spam Classifier based binary classification model to detect whether a text message is spam or not (i.e Ham).
In this project, I have used many algorithms to create a model that can classify SMS messages as spam or not spam. Being able to identify spam messages is a binary classification problem as messages are classified as either 'Spam' or 'Not Spam'. Also, this is a supervised learning problem, as we will be feeding a labelled dataset into the model, that it can learn from, to make future predictions.
